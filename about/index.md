#These words subject to change


As an artist I am developing relationships to mediums. 

Learning about the [idiosyncracies](http://codedoval.posterous.com/4-track-tape) of those mediums.

Developing and applying techniques to express my self.

looking inside myself. Observing the people and things around me.
 
Making connections between senses.

thinking in metaphors. Shapes, textures, motion. Sound is the primary medium at this moment.

I am not not a dancer. This is not a knot.

Language, semantics, vocabulary. Play.

A continual process of creating vocabulary, letting it move through me, repeating what i remember, documenting, reviewing...an iterative process of feedback, resonance, noticing.

Learning to make decisions.taking snapshots. Untangling. Tangling. Moving things around.

Distortion complexity subtlety discovery many layers of experience.
